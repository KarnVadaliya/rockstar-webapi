When the days are cold<br>
And the cards all fold<br>
And the saints we see<br>
Are all made of gold<br>
When your dreams all fail<br>
And the ones we hail<br>
Are the worst of all<br>
And the blood's run stale<br><br>
I wanna hide the truth<br>
I wanna shelter you<br>
But with the beast inside<br>
There's nowhere we can hide<br>
No matter what we breed<br>
We still are made of greed<br>
This is my kingdom come (x2)<br><br>
When you feel my heat<br>
Look into my eyes<br>
It's where my demons hide (x2)<br>
Don't get too close<br>
It's dark inside<br>
It's where my demons hide (x2)<br><br>
