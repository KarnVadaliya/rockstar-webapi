I just pretend that I'm in the dark and<br>
I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss<br>
I'd rather be so oblivious<br>
I'd rather be with you<br><br>
When it's said, when it's done, yeah<br>
I don't ever wanna know<br>
I can tell what you done, yeah<br>
When I look at you<br><br>
In your eyes<br>
I see there's something burning inside you<br>
Oh, inside you<br>
In your eyes<br>
I know it hurts to smile, but you try to<br>
Oh, you try to<br>
You always try to hide the pain<br>
You always know just what to say<br>
I always look the other way<br>
I'm blind, I'm blind<br>
In your eyes<br>
You lie, but I don't let it define you<br>
Oh, define you<br><br>
